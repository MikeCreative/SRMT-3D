# SRMT-3D
 SRMT 3D Algorithm. SLIC + SRM (Work in Progress)

This application provides a simple interface for SRMT-3D. It is heavily work in progress.

Steps

SLIC 3D - Superpixel generation in 3D space for an input stack of images. (Complete, to Optimise/Improve)

SRM 3D - Statistical Region Merging. This algorithm merges together the superpixels generated by SLIC. (Coming Feb/March)

SRM - Texture - Texture Criterion for SRM algorithm. (Coming March/April)

Constant Updates - UI/Options/CUDA Implementation
